Previously we have used Python's file handling mechanisms to solve file related problems. 
With the addition of running shell commands from our programs and handling the output in the script, some of these tasks become easier. 
Feel free to solve the following problems in whichever way you feel is easiest to you. Avoid excessive use of third party libraries.

1) Implement a Python script that completes the following steps:
  - Create a random number (5-10) of new, empty randomly named files;
  - Associate an index with each of these files in your script (that is a number from 1 to <the number of files you have>);
  - Write the following string to each of the files:
     This file's index is: <index>
     Replace the <index> with the actual index of the file
  - Read the contents of the files and print that on screen;
  - Remove the files.
*Be careful with the last step. Take a snapshot of your VM to be sure.

2) Write a program that lists the contents of a given directory just like "ls -l" would but filter out all lines containing the string 'banana'.
Implement the filtering on Python side.
