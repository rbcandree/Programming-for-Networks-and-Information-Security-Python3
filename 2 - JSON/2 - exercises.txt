0) Request the JSON-formatted user list from: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users 
Form a new JSON that contains a list of the users with the following information only: 
  name, phone number and geo location.

To make sure that you have formed the JSON correctly print the string.

1)
a) Given the following dictionary:
dict_to_jsonify = {'iron': 5, 'silver': 7, 'gold': 3, 'copper': 4}
Write a program that produces indented json string from the dictionary.

b) Given the following json string:
employee_json = '{"name": "Teppo", "age": 32, "class": "IT"}'
Write a program that produces a python object from the string.

2) Implement a program that opens weather-data.json
You can open this file from your own hard drive like this:

import json
with open('D:\\path_to_the_file\\weather-data.json') as fh:
data =json.load(fh)

*notice the use of the escape character \ in front of the directory path steps.
Find out programmatically how many KUITUVASTE_SUURI_1 measurements have been made. 
You may need to have a look at the json file to find out how to handle it in Python.

3) Acquire the JSON file from: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
Implement a function that explores the form of the JSON file and outputs the following information:
 - The keys used in the dictionary;
 - The range of userIds;
 - The range of taskIds;
 - The number of completed tasks;
 - The number of tasks with the word "delectus" in their title.

4) Take the JSON from the exercise 2. 
The related user information can be found from: 
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

Use these 2 JSON files and programmatically find out the names of the users with the most completed tasks. 
You can assume that the id in the users-JSON refers to the userID in the todos-JSON.
