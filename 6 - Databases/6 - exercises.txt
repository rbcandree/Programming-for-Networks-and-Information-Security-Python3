dbms = database management system, in this case the postgreSQL

1) First we will build an utility program that helps us reset the database table we are working with.

There's a data.txt file. 
Implement a program that connects to the database, drops the table called table_1 if it exists and afterwards created a new table with the same name. 
The table needs to be formed similarly as in table_1 so that the data in data.txt fits it.

After dropping and re-creating the table, your program reads data.txt and inserts the data into the database table you just created.

*Hint:
When inserting multiple values at the same time, you will probably need to separate the values in the SQL string into different string parameters:

"""INSERT INTO table_abc (field_name1, field_name2, field_name3) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)"""

where the %s are the different string parameters for the SQL statement. 
When calling the execute method of the cursor, the second parameter containing the values for these string parameters needs to be a sequence. 
In this case, either a list or a tuple. Syntax for a tuple with just a single value is as follows:
tuple_variable = ("some_value_here",)
*notice the comma following the string

2) Modify the previously created program in such a way that it generates randomized data. 
Implement it in such a way that program inserts 10 000 rows of data into the database.
What would be a good way to randomize the names? Consider approach that produces names that are actually recognizable as names.
