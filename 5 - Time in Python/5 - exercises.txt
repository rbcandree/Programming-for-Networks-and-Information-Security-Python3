1) Write a program that prints the following information on screen:

a) You are allowed to do certain operations on datetime objects. 
Create 2 separate datetime objects that refer to different points in time and explore the results of following operations:
dt_obj_1 - dt_obj_2
dt_obj_1 < dt_obj_2
What can you tell about the - and < operators for datatime objects?

b) Current time in epoch format. 
What kind of operations are available for time represented in epoch format? 
Convert the seconds since epoch to a more human readable format and print that also on screen.

2) Given a string "2020-09-28  18:47:50", convert the string into a datetime object. 
Access the objects year, month, day and hour attributes separately and print the result on screen. 
Raise all of these values by one. Convert the resulting datetime object into a string of format YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS.

Do the same conversion but with the resulting string in format:
"It's year 2021, day 29 of month 10 and it is 19:47:50."

3) In weather-data.json roadstations with roadstation Id's 10038 and 19958 have faulty time synchronization.
Fix the timestamps of all the measurements done on these stations by adding 2 minutes to the measuredtime attributes of the measurements 
and writing the corrected information into the weather-data.json overwriting the faulty information.

4)
a) Find out programmatically which day of the week was on 1.10.1999
b) Find out programmatically which day is 27 weeks before 1.10.1999
c) Find out programmatically which day of the week is 157 days after 1.10.1999
*Hint: strftime() method may help you with these.
